FTC code project for 2021-2022 FF code for our state (and maybe even worlds) robot.

## Installation

For more detailed instructions on getting FTC FF setup in your own project, see the [owner](https://github.com/AlessioToniolo) of this repo.

1. Download or clone this repo.

1. Open the project in Android Studio and build `TeamCode` like any other `ftc_app` project.

1. Use Android Studio's VCS (version control system) options **in order to fetch current code**. Code is updated on other computers, so ***every time you run the robot or upload code, please use the FETCH option in VCS to get the current code***, then you can upload and then run the code.
